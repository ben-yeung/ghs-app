## Summary
The GHS App was created to help students, parents, and teachers on a daily basis. Access to resources such as Aeries, schedules, maps, and events provides a quick, easy, and reliable way to stay updated. 
The GHS App is one of the best ways for students and parents to become more familiar with teachers, staff, and the campus itself. 

## Inside the app
The app is primarily Swift3/4 with some Objective-C to bridge headers for external APIs. GET requests pull data from Google Calendars and Google Sheets and this JSON is parsed/allocated into TableViews.

Other APIs include Lottie, Firebase, Alamofire, and TwitterCore. 

These packages are managed by CocoaPods.
